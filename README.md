Our honour to be mentioned by Judea Pearl on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ceobillionaire/status/1388630546797023232).

      Aspiration to learn everything from data alone has 
      kept the ML community away from science.

The looper is aim at providing a resource list, code snippets or small scale software solutions for causal analysis in different areas. 
It's name is inspired from brialliant movie [looper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looper_(film)), which has a premise of time-like curve.

The main entry is a markdown file as follows, any looper specific internal examples
