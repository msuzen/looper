Our honour to be mentioned by Judea Pearl on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ceobillionaire/status/1388630546797023232).

```
 
      Aspiration to learn everything from data alone has 
      kept the ML community away from science.

A resource list, code snippets or small scale software solutions for causal analysis in different areas. The name is inspired from the movie [looper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looper_(film)), which has a premise of time-like loops, probably the most complex causal subject from physics point of view.

The main entry is a markdown file as follows, any looper specific internal examples are lined there too : 

* [A resource list for causality in statistics, data science and physics](looper.md)
  Other  fields of course such as econometrics, epidemiology and many more.

## Looper Nuggets

Looper Nuggets mimick a glossary of terms and concepts in causal inference, though they are entry to 
understanding concepts in pedagogical manner. See the list of
them [here](nuggets/looper_nuggets.md).
